			<p id="summary">The cheetah has an extra-large heart, nostrils and lungs that help the cat process more oxygen while running. The animal's body is also aerodynamic for more speed.
The cheetah's spotted fur helps it blend into the grass so that it can stay hidden from prey until ready to pursue.
Once, emperors and other royalty kept cheetahs as pets. In the 16th century, cheetahs were trained and used to hunt gazelles.
